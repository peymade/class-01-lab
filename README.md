# Lab 01 Code 301

## Project Description

Hi there! This project was completed for the Code Fellows 301 Lab 01 assignment. I have created different components for the Header, Main, Footer, and HornedBeasts. I called the HornedBeasts component twice to make two instances of animals and their information appear on the screen. 

## Questions

I am wondering how to make something happen only once in a component when you are calling it multiple times. For example- can I display the name of the section "Horned Beasts" in the horned beasts component file without having it repeat twice? 

Is there an easier way to get CSS styles to apply to multiple components? Is it best practice to make a separate css file for each component?
