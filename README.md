# Lab 01 Code 301

## Project Description

Hi there! This project was completed for the Code Fellows 301 Lab 01 assignment. I have created different components for the Header, Main, Footer, and HornedBeasts. I called the HornedBeasts component twice to make two instances of animals and their information appear on the screen. 

## Questions

I am wondering how to make something happen only once in a component when you are calling it multiple times. For example- can I display the name of the section "Horned Beasts" in the horned beasts component file without having it repeat twice?
